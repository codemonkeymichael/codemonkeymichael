Hi, Iâ€™m @codemonkeymichael   

I work at <a href="https://www.technipfmc.com/en/what-we-do/subsea/robotics/">Schilling Robtics</a> in Davis California. We make under sea remote control robots, so cool. I work mostly in C# .NET 6.0 Blazor on the ERP and wearhousing extention software. Im also a director at the <a href="https://heartstoppershaunt.com/">Heartstopper Hauted House</a> in Rancho Cordova California. Most of the code in this repo is for animatronic and stage automation for endevor.
